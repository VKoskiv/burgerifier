World's FASTEST burger creation program.

Compile with:
cmake . && make

Usage:
./bin/🍔 <amount of burgers>

If you want to store the burgers for later:
./bin/🍔 25 > burgers.txt

I suggest you install it globally on all your systems:
cp bin/🍔 /usr/local/bin/

Then you can just burger away
🍔 50000 > breakfast.txt
